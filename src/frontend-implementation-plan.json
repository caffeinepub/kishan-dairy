Position the badge prominently (e.g., top-right corner or below product image) using absolute positioning or flex layout. Style the badge with earthy theme colors (use OKLCH color variables from the theme) with appropriate padding, rounded corners, and contrasting text. Ensure the badge does not obscure the product image, name, price, or add-to-cart button. The badge should be visually distinct but harmonize with the existing card design."
