  "summary": "The implementation is largely complete and aligns well with the BuildRequest. All major requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-8) have been implemented. However, there are a few gaps: the backend lacks explicit 'update product' functionality, the shopping cart implementation needs refinement for quantity updates and item removal to persist to the backend, and address validation for Sitamarhi is present in the frontend but not enforced in the backend.",
