  "summary": "All requirements from the BuildRequest have been implemented. REQ-9 adds the 'isInstant' boolean field to the Product type in backend/main.mo and includes migration logic. REQ-10 is partially addressed by the migration setting isInstant to false by default, but the BuildRequest specifically requires all dairy products to have isInstant set to true, which is not evident from the diff. REQ-11 is fully implemented with an 'Instant' badge displayed on ProductCard using a lightning icon (Zap) and earthy accent styling.",
